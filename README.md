🚴‍♂️ Chain Tensioner Mechanism — Group Project

Overview:
This project involves the design, fabrication, and testing of a chain tensioner mechanism to maintain optimal chain tension in mechanical systems. The model was developed using SolidWorks, and the prototype was fabricated through 3D printing and CO₂ laser cutting techniques.

Key Features:

Designed a CAD model of the chain tensioner assembly in SolidWorks ensuring proper kinematic alignment.

Used 3D printing to manufacture the main structural components for lightweight and accuracy.

Fabricated the tension shoe/pad using CO₂ laser cutting for smooth operation and wear resistance.

Assembled and tested to validate tension adjustment and mechanical stability.

Tools & Technologies:
SolidWorks · 3D Printing · CO₂ Laser Cutting · Acrylic & PLA Materials

Outcome:
Achieved a functional prototype capable of maintaining consistent chain tension with modular and replaceable parts.
